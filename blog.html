        <li>what is the between Map and FoEach function?
            <p> <span class="text-danger">Answer:-</span> <span class="fw-bold">Map and ForEach:-</span>Map is a function which apply only on array .. That's why its called an array method . map task is so simple. It takes an array and create a new arrey by manipulating each element of an existing array. It can't change original array . And <b>ForEach</b> function exactly do the same work. Both do loop through an arrey . But map function returns the array and ForEach dosen't reuturn anything.. Thats the basic deference of Map and ForEach function.</p>

        <li>what is the between Filter and Find function?
            <p> <span class="text-danger">Answer:-</span> <span class="fw-bold">Filter and Find:-</span> This two also is an array method . Filter and Find usally use for to loop through an arrey but based on a condition . If requred condition match for the target array than Filter and Find function show this results. However, they have different use cases and return different results. <b>Filter </b> method returns a new array but didn't change original array . it's made a array by itself and retun this array also . On the other hand, <b>Find</b> method returns only the first element in an array which is matched the given condition. Thats the basic deference of Filter and Find function.</p>
